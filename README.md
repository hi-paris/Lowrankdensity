# LowRankDensity
In the present paper we incorporate rank constraint into density estimation problem. In the
discrete case, we assume that the density can be represented as a low-rank matrix. In the continuous case, we assume that the density is bi-variate and Lipschitz-continuous over a compact
rectangular support. Additionally, we assume that it can be decomposed as a sum of separable
functions. We introduce a new histogram-type estimator that demonstrates faster convergence
rates under such low-rank constraints. In the continuous case, our estimator converges in total
variation at the classical one-dimensional rate n
âˆ’1/3
, up to logarithmic factors. We also establish
lower bounds for the discrete and continuous problems, which confirm that our convergence rates
are minimax optimal (up to some additional logarithmic factors). Finally, we present efficient
algorithms for computing our estimators.

In this Package you can use 2 differents types of approaches:

* lowrankdensity.continuous
* lowrankdensity.discrete
